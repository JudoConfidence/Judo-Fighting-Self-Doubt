                        <p>Judo, translated as "the gentle way," is a modern martial art, combat sport, and philosophy founded in Japan in 1882 by Jigoro Kano. It is a physical, mental, and moral teaching system that emphasizes the use of technique and leverage to overcome a stronger opponent.</p>
                        
                        <p>The core of judo is not about brute force, but about using an opponent's own strength and momentum against them. This principle, known as <strong>Seiryoku-Zenyo</strong> (maximum efficiency, minimum effort), teaches that true power comes from skill, timing, and understanding, not just physical size.</p>

                            <p>Judo was created by <strong>Jigoro Kano (1860-1938)</strong>, a Japanese educator who was often bullied due to his small stature. He began studying jujutsu to build strength but envisioned a safer, more educational system.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 1882, Kano established the <strong>Kodokan Judo Institute</strong> in Tokyo. He became the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee in 1909, and judo was introduced as an Olympic sport at the 1964 Tokyo Games.</p>
